        // Event Handling works on the publish subscriber modal in which there is a event generator like button here who generates events like click then we have subscriber or event handler or event listner or participant who is generated or who has subscribed or participated who is eagerly listening when he will be called and then at last we have subscription i.e contract b/w publisher and subscriber like we all have in daily life like subscripting to netflix and many more

        
        let txt=document.getElementsByTagName("input");
        console.log(txt);
        txt[2].onkeydown=function(){
            div.innerHTML=this.value;
        }

        // This is very powerful tool mostly the event object which is used to a lot of things .There are three ways to add handler i.e
        // 1.html attribute onclick=fun()  or any event using on keyword before and then writing the function/handler for that in the justify-content

        // 2.Firstly getting from the dom and then adding property onclick or any event using on keyword befor but everything in the JS

        // 3. Last but not the least addEventListener('click',function(e){},true/false) This is very powerful the first parameter is passed to process the event u want like click,mouseenter,mouseover and etc. The 2nd parameter is the handler itself and the third parmeter which takes either true or false where true means capturing mode and false means bubbling mode which is the default one .

        // do take a look at bubbling and capturing mode very imp
