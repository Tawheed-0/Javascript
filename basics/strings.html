        // let str="Tawheed";


        // 1.  length

        // This is not a function rather it is an property which is used to get the length of the string.

        // let len=str.length;
        // console.log(len);


        // 2.  indexOf

        // This function is used to get the index of any desired character which is present in the string.In this function search starts from 0 index i.e from start.

        // let ind=str.indexOf('w');
        // console.log(ind);

        // 3.  lastIndexOf

        // This function is used to get the index of any desired character which is present in the string.In this function search starts from n-1 index i.e from last.

        // let ind=str.lastIndexOf('w');
        // console.log(ind);

        // 4.  substr

        // This function is used to get a part of string which can be used anywhere else.This is the old way or old function as it was before echma 6. This works on the count rather than index its first parameter is given from where to start and that index is included and the 2nd is how many after that u want to get .

        // let sub=str.substr(1,3);        //its like form tawheed's a(1 index) to 3 after that i.e awh
        // console.log(sub);

        // 5.  substring

        // This function is used to get a part of string which can be used anywhere else.This is the new way or new function as it was introduced after echma 6. This works on the index rather than count its first parameter is given from where to start and that index is included and the 2nd is to which index and that index which is provided is excluded .

        // let sub=str.substring(1,3);        //its like form tawheed's a(1 index) to 3 index that i.e aw
        // console.log(sub);

        // 6.  slice

        // This function works same as but it is specially used for arrays (i.e Number type arrays) this slice function works on both arrays and strings but substring works only on strings.

        // let slice=str.substring(1,3);        //its like form tawheed's a(1 index) to 3 index that i.e aw
        // console.log(slice);
