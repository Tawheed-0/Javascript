        // 1. toUpperCase()
        
        // let name="tawheed";
        // let n=name.toUpperCase();
        // console.log(n);

        // This function is used to change any string to uppercase  this function doesn't change the original string

        // 2. toLowerCase()

        // let name="TAWHEED";
        // let n=name.toLowerCase();
        // console.log(n);

        // This function is used to change any string to lowercase this function doesn't change the original string

        // 3. startsWith()

        // This function is used mainly in filter or search related works it is as it filters all the names or anything that starts with the given condition 


        // 3. endsWith()

        // This function is used mainly in filter or search related works it is as it filters all the names or anything that ends with the given condition 



         // let str="Tawheed";


        // 4.  length

        // This is not a function rather it is an property which is used to get the length of the string.

        // let len=str.length;
        // console.log(len);


        // 5.  indexOf

        // This function is used to get the index of any desired character which is present in the string.In this function search starts from 0 index i.e from start.

        // let ind=str.indexOf('w');
        // console.log(ind);

        // 6.  lastIndexOf

        // This function is used to get the index of any desired character which is present in the string.In this function search starts from n-1 index i.e from last.

        // let ind=str.lastIndexOf('w');
        // console.log(ind);

        // 7.  substr

        // This function is used to get a part of string which can be used anywhere else.This is the old way or old function as it was before echma 6. This works on the count rather than index its first parameter is given from where to start and that index is included and the 2nd is how many after that u want to get .

        // let sub=str.substr(1,3);        //its like form tawheed's a(1 index) to 3 after that i.e awh
        // console.log(sub);

        // 8.  substring

        // This function is used to get a part of string which can be used anywhere else.This is the new way or new function as it was introduced after echma 6. This works on the index rather than count its first parameter is given from where to start and that index is included and the 2nd is to which index and that index which is provided is excluded .

        // let sub=str.substring(1,3);        //its like form tawheed's a(1 index) to 3 index that i.e aw
        // console.log(sub);

        // 9.  slice

        // This function works same as but it is specially used for arrays (i.e Number type arrays) this slice function works on both arrays and strings but substring works only on strings.

        // let slice=str.substring(1,3);        //its like form tawheed's a(1 index) to 3 index that i.e aw
        // console.log(slice);

        // All methods on above string Tawheed

        // 10.  charAt

        // let arr="tawheed";
        // let res=arr.charAt(1);
        // console.log(res);


        // This function is used  to get the character at the entered index which is sent as parameter


        // 11. charCodeAt

        // let arr="tawheed";
        // let res=arr.charCodeAt(2);
        // console.log(res);


        // This function is used  to get the character's ascii code at the entered index which is sent as parameter

        // 12. concat

        // let str1="Tawheed";
        // let str2=" Rafiq";
        // let str3=str1.concat(str2);
        // console.log(str3);


        // This function is used to concat two functions instead of this we use '+' operator


        // 14.  trim

        // let str="   Tawheed     ";
        // let res=str.trim();
        // console.log(res);

        // This function is used to delete (i.e trim ) spaces from left and right side.

        // -> trimstart
        // -> trimend
        // These are two more funs which are used to trim from start or end

        // 15.  repeat

        // let str="Tawheed Rafiq ";
        // let res=str.repeat(100);
        // // let res="Tawheed ".repeat(100);
        // console.log(res);

        // This function is used to repeat a particular word,line or paragraph as many times as u wnat by just giving the no. as parameter.


        // 16.  replace

        // let str="Blue house has blue paint with blue table";
        // let res =str.replace("Blue","Green");
        // let res =str.replace(/Blue/gi,"Green");
        // console.log(res);


        // This function is used to replace a particular word which is given as first parameter and the 2nd parameter is given as with whom u want to replace.

        // But by this let res =str.replace("Blue","Green"); it will only replace the first one i.e first Blue and other words like it will be as its

        // But by using this let res =str.replace(/Blue/gi,"Green"); it changes all the blues in the string .In it 'g' means globally and 'i' means case insensitive. we have one more function to replace all but that doesn't have case insensitive feature i.e replaceAll();


        // 17.  split


        // let str="Tawheed Rafiq Dar";
        // let res = str.split(' ');
        // console.log(res);


        // let str="44232646332,9622867605,7780940182,8803450670";
        // let res = str.split(',');
        // console.log(res);

        // This function is used to split the string into smaller peices which are stored as array .In this function the parameter is sent where to split,break the array every time it sees that symbol or whatever is sent it break it and saves that part in array.Very useful
